You are of course required to follow all previous licenses. Rom, Merc, Diku.
I have no added restrictions.

You need to have Miniboa installed somewhere on the python path. Easiest thing
is to just stick it in the /pysrc directory. You can get it from
https://github.com/marlboromoo/miniboa

If you want to run it head to the /pysrc directory and boot. "python ./pyom.py"

There's an interactive shell included. Boot in /pysrc with "python ./shell.py"

You can configure basic options in /pysrc/settings.py including the default boot port.

This is an alpha release. Expect a bumpy road!
